# Installation

VocalPy can be installed with either one of two package managers, pip and conda.
To install VocalPy, copy and paste one of the commands below in the terminal.

```{eval-rst}

.. tabs::

   .. code-tab:: shell with ``pip``

         pip install vocalpy

   .. code-tab:: shell with ``conda``

         conda install vocalpy -c conda-forge

```

If you are starting a new project, we recommend creating a new virtual environment, 
and installing VocalPy into that environment [^1][^2][^3].
If you are using conda, you should prefer installing VocalPy with conda, not pip [^4].
