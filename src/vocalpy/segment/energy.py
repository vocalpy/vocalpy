    """Find segments in audio by thresholding the smoothed energy.

    Converts audio to smoothed energy
    using :func:`vocalpy.signal.audio.smoothed_energy`,
    that computes a running average of the squared signal
    by convolving with a window of size ``smooth_win``
    milliseconds.
    Then finds all continuous periods
    above ``threshold``, that are considered candidate segments.
    Candidates are removed that have a duration less than
    ``minimum_dur``, and then any two segments with a silent
    gap between them less than ``min_silent_dur`` are merged
    into a single segment. The segments remaining after this
    post-processing are returned as onset and offset times
    in two numpy arrays.

    Parameters
    ----------
    audio: vocalpy.Audio
        An audio signal.
    smooth_win : integer
        Size of smoothing window in milliseconds. Default is 2.
    threshold : int
        Value above which smoothed energy is considered part of a segment.
        Default is 5000.
    min_dur : float
        Minimum duration of a segment, in seconds.
        Default is 0.02, i.e. 20 ms.
    min_silent_dur : float
        Minimum duration of silent gap between segments, in seconds.
        Default is 0.002, i.e. 2 ms.

    Returns
    -------
    onsets_s : numpy.ndarray
        Vector of onset times of segments, in seconds.
    offsets_s : numpy.ndarray
        Vector of offset times of segments, in seconds.
