    Attributes
    ----------
    threshold : int
        Value above which mean squared signal is considered part of a segment.
        Default is 5000.
    min_dur : float
        Minimum duration of a segment, in seconds.
        Default is 0.02, i.e. 20 ms.
    min_silent_dur : float
        Minimum duration of silent gap between segments, in seconds.
        Default is 0.002, i.e. 2 ms.
    freq_cutoffs : Iterable
        Cutoff frequencies for bandpass filter.
        List or tuple with two elements, default is ``(500, 10000)``.
    smooth_win : int
        Size of smoothing window in milliseconds. Default is 2.
    scale : bool
        If True, scale the ``sound.data``.
        Default is True.
        This is needed to replicate the behavior of ``evsonganaly``,
        which assumes the audio data is loaded as 16-bit integers.
        Since the default for :class:`vocalpy.Sound` is to load sounds
        with a numpy dtype of float64, this function defaults to
        multiplying the ``sound.data`` by 2**15,
        and then casting to the int16 dtype.
        This replicates the behavior of the ``evsonganaly`` function,
        given data with dtype float64.
        If you have loaded a sound with a dtype of int16,
        then set this to False.
    scale_val :
        Value to multiply the ``sound.data`` by, to scale the data.
        Default is 2**15.
        Only used if ``scale`` is ``True``.
        This is needed to replicate the behavior of ``evsonganaly``,
        which assumes the audio data is loaded as 16-bit integers.
    scale_dtype : numpy.dtype
        Numpy Dtype to cast ``sound.data`` to, after scaling.
        Default is ``np.int16``.
        Only used if ``scale`` is ``True``.
        This is needed to replicate the behavior of ``ava``,
        which assumes the audio data is loaded as 16-bit integers.

    """Segment audio by thresholding the mean squared signal.

    Converts audio to the mean squared of the signal
    (using :func:`vocalpy.signal.audio.meansquared`).
    Then finds all continuous periods
    in the mean squared signal above ``threshold``.
    These periods are considered candidate segments.
    Candidates are removed that have a duration less than
    ``minimum_dur``; then, any two segments with a silent
    gap between them less than ``min_silent_dur`` are merged
    into a single segment. The segments remaining after this
    post-processing are returned as onset and offset times
    in two NumPy arrays.

    Note that :func:`vocalpy.signal.audio.meansquared`
    first filters the audio, with
    :func:`vocalpy.signal.audio.bandpass_filtfilt`,
    using ``freq_cutoffs``, and then computes
    a running average of the squared signal
    by convolving with a window of size ``smooth_win``
    milliseconds.
