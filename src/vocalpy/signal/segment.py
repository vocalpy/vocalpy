    """Segment audio into a sequence of units.

    Applies a threshold below which is considered silence,
    and then finds all continuous periods above the threshold
    that are bordered by silent gaps.
    All such periods are considered a :class:`vocalpy.Unit`.
    This function returns a :class:`vocalpy.Sequence`
    of such units.

    Note that before segmenting,
    the audio is first smoothed with
    :func:`vocalpy.signal.segment.smooth`.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data : numpy.ndarray
        An audio signal as a :class:`numpy.ndarray`.
        Typically, the `data` attribute from a :class:`vocalpy.Audio` instance.
    samplerate : int
        The sampling rate.
        Typically, the `samplerate` attribute from a :class:`vocalpy.Audio` instance.
    smooth_win : integer
        Size of smoothing window in milliseconds. Default is 2.
    threshold : int
        Value above which amplitude is considered part of a segment.
        Default is 5000.
    min_dur : float
        Minimum duration of a segment, in seconds.
        Default is 0.02, i.e. 20 ms.
    min_silent_dur : float
        Minimum duration of silent gap between segments, in seconds.
        Default is 0.002, i.e. 2 ms.

    Returns
    -------
    sequence : vocalpy.Sequence
        A :class:`vocalpy.Sequence` made up of `vocalpy.Unit` instances.
