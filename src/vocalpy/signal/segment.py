    """Filter raw audio and smooth signal
    used to calculate amplitude.

    Parameters
    ----------
    audio : vocalpy.Audio
        An instance of :class:`vocalpy.Audio`.
    freq_cutoffs : list
        Cutoff frequencies for bandpass filter.
        Two-element sequence of integers,
        (low frequency cutoff, high frequency cutoff).
        Default is [500, 10000].
        If None, bandpass filter is not applied.
    smooth_win : integer
        Size of smoothing window in milliseconds. Default is 2.

    Returns
    -------
    audio_smoothed : vocalpy.Audio
        With pre-processing applied to the `data` attribute.

    Applies a bandpass filter with the frequency cutoffs in spect_params,
    then rectifies the signal by squaring, and lastly smooths by taking
    the average within a window of size sm_win.
    This is a very literal translation from the Matlab function SmoothData.m
    by Evren Tumer. Uses the Thomas-Santana algorithm.

    ----------
    smooth : np.ndarray
        Smoothed audio waveform, returned by evfuncs.smooth_data
    samp_freq : int
        Sampling frequency at which audio was recorded. Returned by

    threshold : int
        value above which amplitude is considered part of a segment.
        Default is 5000.
    min_dur : float
        minimum duration of a segment.
        In .not.mat files saved by evsonganaly, this value is called "min_dur"
        Default is 0.02, i.e. 20 ms.
    min_silent_dur : float
        minimum duration of silent gap between segment.
        In .not.mat files saved by evsonganaly, this value is called "min_int"
        Default is 0.002, i.e. 2 ms.
    return_sample : bool
        if True, returns the onsets and offsets in sample numbers (from audio signal).
        Default is False.
